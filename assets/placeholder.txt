IMPORTANT: ADDING REQUIRED IMAGES
===========================

For the portfolio to display correctly, please add the following image to this directory:

1. nishidh-jasani.jpg - Your profile photo for the About Me section
   - This should be the image you shared showing you in a cream and navy polo shirt
   - Recommended size: at least 600x600px, square aspect ratio

The About Me section is set up to use this image with a grayscale effect on load,
which transitions to color on hover - providing an elegant animation effect that
matches the black and white theme.

If the image isn't available, a text placeholder will be shown instead.

You can manually copy your profile image to this folder with this simple command:
copy [path-to-your-image] assets/nishidh-jasani.jpg

2. project1.jpg - Screenshot of your ClothLoop project (recommended size: 800x500px)

3. project2.jpg - Screenshot of your HRIMWellness project (recommended size: 800x500px)

4. project3.jpg - Screenshot of your DataVizPro collaboration project (recommended size: 800x500px)

Without these images, placeholder images will be displayed. To ensure your portfolio looks professional, please add these images to the assets directory.

These images will be used in your portfolio website.
